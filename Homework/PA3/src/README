ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]


All code is written by myself.

KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:


All classes compiled correctly.

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

Inside the class MineField, a zero padding minefield is used. I just extend the origin minefield from size of (ROWS,COLUMNS)
to size of (ROWS+2,COLUMNS+2), which is more convenient for function numAdjacentMines. Respectively, I write a private function 
named Index_transformation to change the position index from (i,j) to (i+1,j+1) in minefield with zero padding. All of these 
coordinates transformation is wrapped inside the class MineField. Thus, after we design this class and call this class outside, 
we do not need to think about it anymore.
